# Mordan's Christmas Minimod
Mordanâ€™s Christmas Minimod for oBG2 from Spellhold Studios.

Quoth the Spellhold Studios page:

"Okay, I found this old mod of Mordan's in the dusty recesses of my HD. It's been converted to weidu, bugfixed, and expanded to no longer need the CLUAConsole. (It's was a creation of a TeamBG Xmas mod contest similar to the Iron Modder ones of FWP fame.) So it IS silly. However, it is amusing and does deliver a usable item to the party in the end. It even includes a custom made area by Mordan.

To start: Go to the Mithrest Inn in the Promenade sometime after chapter 2. Then follow the clues.
